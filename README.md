Telaro weaves readable but randomly-generated sentences from a set of characters.

This is useful for type designers, who prototype fonts by drawing a small number of letters and then typeset a text with them, using only those letters yet that can still be read normally. [See the wiki for more information...](http://code.google.com/p/telaro/wiki/Home)

Telaro is the Venetian word for "loom," and it is programmed in Python with Pyjamas.

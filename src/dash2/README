Telaro - http://code.google.com/p/telaro/
==========================================

Telaro is the Venetian word for "loom."

Telaro weaves readable but randomly-generated sentences from a list of 
words and key characters.

This is useful for type designers, who prototype fonts by drawing a 
small number of letters and then typesetting a text which only uses 
those small number of letters yet can be read normally.

Please see INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.

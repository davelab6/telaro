A very brief walk through of how to get Dash2 running:

Create the db:

    * mysql -u root
    * > CREATE DATABASE dash2;
    * > grant all privilages to dash2.* to 'dash2'@'localhost'; (or possibly > grant all on dash2.* to 'dash2'@'localhost';)
    * > exit;

Create the tables:

    * cd dash2
    * python manage.py syncdb

Build the javascript:

    * cd media
    * vim build.sh
    * (edit this so that it points to the build.py of pyjamas)
    * ./build.sh

Run the server:

    * python manage.py runserver

Test it out:
